## Welcome to LIRI!!!!

This serves almost the same purpose as SIRI but rather than speak what you'd like it to do
you can just type it in your commandline!

The following commands include:
	
	* my-tweets

	*spotify-this-song

	*movie-this

	*do-what-it-says

## Important

whatever the user puts in the command line for the value needs to be in a string.

Also API keys for twitter and spotify are required as they are not included upon cloning.

## Conclusion

have fun and play with the txt file to see what it can really do!
